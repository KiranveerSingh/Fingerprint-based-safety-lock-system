Step 1: Selected Project Idea
- Decided to build a Fingerprint-Based Door Lock System using Arduino Uno and R307 Fingerprint Sensor.

Step 2: Collected Components
- Arduino Uno
- R307 Fingerprint Sensor
- Solenoid Lock
- Relay Module
- Jumper Wires
- Power Supply (9–12V)

Step 3: Designed the Circuit
- Connected R307 sensor to Arduino Uno (TX, RX, VCC, GND).
- Connected relay module to Arduino digital pin.
- Connected solenoid lock to relay output.
- Powered Arduino with 9–12V adapter.

Step 4: Wrote the Code
- Created two Arduino IDE codes:
  1. enrollment.ino → to store fingerprints in sensor memory.
  2. detection.ino → to verify fingerprints and control solenoid lock.

Step 5: Uploaded and Tested Enrollment Code
- Uploaded enrollment.ino to Arduino Uno.
- Registered multiple fingerprints into the sensor.

Step 6: Uploaded and Tested Detection Code
- Uploaded detection.ino to Arduino Uno.
- Tested with authorized fingerprints → solenoid lock opened.
- Tested with unauthorized fingerprints → access denied.

Step 7: Assembled Hardware
- Mounted Arduino, relay, and sensor on Wooden structure.
- Connected solenoid lock to structure for demonstration.
- Ensured stable power supply to all components.

Step 8: Documented Project
- Created folder structure with ArduinoIDE-Code and Images.
- Added README.md and LICENSE to GitHub repository.
- Uploaded images of circuit and prototype.

Step 9: Final Testing and Validation
- Tested with multiple fingerprints.
- Validated security and reliability of system.
- Completed project documentation for GitHub.
